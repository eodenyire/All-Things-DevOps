## Common Myths about DevOps 

- **DevOps is only for startups**    
Various organizations, regardless of whether they are a new-comer or an already established titan in the tech industry, have been able to transform their architecture, technical practices, and culture that create amazing outcomes that  we associate with DevOps.

- **DevOps replaces Agile**   
DevOps principles and practices are compatible with Agile, with many observing that DevOps as a logical continuation of the Agile journey. The goal is to have our code in an "always deployable state" at the end of each iteration. 

- **DevOps is incompatible with ITIL**   
Many areas of the ITIL processes becomes fully automated to solve problems associated with configuration and release management processes. Because DevOps require fast detection and recovery when incidents occur, the ITIL disciplines of service design, incident, and problem management remain as relevant as ever.

- **DevOps is incompatible with Information and Security Compliance**   
Instead of security and compliance activities being performed at the end of the project, controls need to be integrated into every stage of daily work in the software development cycle, resulting ina better quality, security, and compliance outcomes.

- **DevOps means eliminating Operations, or "NoOps"**   
IT Operations collaborate far earlier in the software lifecycle with Development, who continues to work with IT Operations long after the code has been deployed into production. IT Operations become more engage in product development, where the product is the platform that developers use to safely, quickly, and securely test, deploy, and run their IT services in production.

- **DevOps is just "Infrastructure-as-Code" or Automation**   
Beside Automation, DevOps requires cultural norms and an architecturethat allows for shared goals to be achieved throughout the IT value stream. 

- **DevOps is only for Open-source Software**   
Achieving DevOps outcomes is independent of the technology being used. Successes have been achieved with applications built using LAMP stack, and applications written in proprietary ones.


## Technical Debts

Technical debt describes how decisions we make lead to problems that get increasingly more difficult to fix overtime, continually reducing our available options in the future - even when talen on judiciously, we still incur interest.

- **"Fixing the mess when time permits"**    
Many of the problems that teams faced are due to applications, and infrastructure that are complex, poorly documented, and incredibly fragile. This is the first technical debt and daily workarounds that we live with constantly, always promising that we'll fix the mess when we have a little more time. But that time never comes. 

- **"Committing to deliver upon a new promise"**   
Development is always tasked with another urgent project that inevitably requires solving new technical challenges and coming up with workarounds to meet the promised release date, further adding to existing technical debt - made, of course, with the promise that we'll fix any resulting problems when we have a little more time.
