# Business Effects of Cloud Migrations



## The Change of Business Dynamics and Procedure

When introducing any change within an organization this will, of course, create ripples internally throughout the business. The effect this can have is all very dependent on the size and impact of these changes.

Some changes may only affect a small group of people within a department, others can affect a number of teams or even the whole organization and can be classed as game changing. When migrating services to the cloud which is fundamentally a change of business strategy affecting the range of internal departments. The affects this can have on the business can be huge. This course will focus on those internal effects.

New sales approach. Depending on which elements of your business you are moving to the cloud, it can now be your organization to blend, mold, and adopt to ever changing market conditions and trends far easier as if you were hosting your services locally all thanks to scalability and flexibility.

Your sales team and lead generators would soon be up to call upon a greater breath of offerings that they could entice new and existing customers with. Largely this is due to the fact the cloud allows your organization to spend more time focusing on increasing innovation and development instead of managing specific services which will now be handled by a public cloud provider.

Being able to adopt to a fluctuating market and invoke a change of direction, business demands and needs are far easier to implement when architecting on top of cloud services. Your sales team can become increasingly diverse in this strategy to attract and gain additional sales. Harnessing the power cloud, no longer will there be an underlying issue resource to scale to meet new big deals as there would've been with a on premise solution.

The team can start approaching customers that may have been out of reach before due to restrictions of your current IT infrastructure capacity. This potentially opens up a whole new world of customers adding diversity to your portfolio.

Advance business analytics. Depending on your business type and industry you may have a need to implement business analytics where by you collect and analyze vast amounts of data which can in turn drive certain decisions within the organization.

Resources to implement such analytical processing can be huge and costly from both a hardware and software perspective alone. The market leaders in public cloud have very specific services relating to business analytics which you can take full advantage of at an incredible scale and with low price points. This allows the business to be incredibly agile and dynamic when it comes to data driven decisions. The amount of resources that can be quickly put behind specific analytics would fire it up by the resources you would have on premise from a cross point alone.

Being able to explore large scale data sets can offer significant advantages when it comes to business improvements and strategy. With more possibilities to perform deep analyzes of your data, for example, sales patterns, product feedback, customer requirements, or even performance statistics of your infrastructure. With information like this available your business can still develop and focus its efforts into improving very targeted areas increasing the overall efficiency of development.

Responsibility. By using cloud services, you have essentially handed over some responsibility of the management of your infrastructure to a third party. With this an element of control is also loss from your organization. From this point onwards, the public cloud vendor is responsible for everything up to the host where your instances are installed. They are responsible for security, maintenance, power, and calling of the host hardware within that data center.

You will no longer have to source, install, cable, and provide power and calling for your services. They have migrated to the cloud. This will reduce your required footprint within your data center and takes pressure off of the data center team. In fact, all future deployments into the cloud infrastructure, you will no longer have to liaise with the data center team as those services will be hosted by a cloud provider within their data center.

The data center manager will no longer have visibility of all architecture within your business. Instead, this will likely have to be managed between different teams, leveraging greater internal department to a collaboration. Depending on the size of your migration, you may need to establish a new account manager who will be responsible for managing communications between your organization and your chosen cloud vendor or vendors.

This may be new for a lot of organizations who have not had a manager vendor with such responsibility over your own IT services. This management may involved analyzing performance metrics, service level expectations, risk, and communications and support.

Process and procedures. Cloud migration is a whole new way of architects in your business IT infrastructure. This will initially bring a lot of administrative changes to your internal process and procedures for many departments. Controlling and managing this transition can be a test in time for all involved if rushed so allow plenty of time to get these implemented.

As this is likely to be the first time your business have migrated services to the cloud, it's all going to have to be done from a blank canvas.

A good place to start would be to identify which areas of the business will be affected by the specific services being migrated. If a team has involvement with that service, then it's likely the will require a change of process.

Some of these teams and departments may include service delivery, finance, support, development and testing, storage and backup, networks, sales, risk, operations, and even human resources. As you can see, this can be a wide scope of teams and can vary depending on how much infrastructure your migrating to the cloud and for what purpose.

Having this new documentation available in the beginning stages will save you a lot of time and effort retrospectively, updating your other business systems, processes, and tools. It's essential all involved in the process of utilizing cloud services have a clear understanding of how they work load will change following the migration.

Some processes may become redundant. Almost certainly there will be new ones created. Communications of the delivery of these processes are essential as during the first few weeks, their likely to change a lot and if someone is working from an outdated version of your procedures, then this will obviously cause problems.

How teams interoperate with each other will also likely change largely due to procedural changes. If you currently have a very siloed department structure then you may need to reevaluate this and loosen any barriers between the teams to allow your workforce to become increasingly dynamic, agile, and flexible much like the cloud infrastructure your business will be running its services on. Use the transition of your migration to define processes that flow effectively between teams.

Cloud management will likely involve new roles, departments and responsibilities and its important that your internal processes and procedures, in particular change management, do not become a bottleneck that slows down the fast growth deployment and scale that the cloud offers. Your internal business operation processes need to rapidly respond adjacently with cloud development through internal collaboration.

Deployment and operations. Some of the biggest changes within your business will be experienced by your development and operations teams but other ones on the ground deploy new resources and infrastructure and getting them operational. New deployments will be significantly different to your existing on premise solutions.

Harnessing the on demand element of cloud computing, no longer will your business have to wait months, weeks, or days for new resources, applications, or whole environments become available. The time saved here helps to bring customer products to market far quicker and more efficiently.

With so many different cloud deployment tools available, there is a huge capacity for your technical team to call upon automation, serverless computing, and self-healing architecture all resulting in a more refined software defined data center.

Through the use of the different cloud services offered, managing deployments, version control, and rollback options are greatly enhanced and optimized giving you increased reliability and delivery of service of your solutions and applications.

If your organization doesn't already have a testing development environment, then it may be a good idea to architect one in the cloud to exactly replicate your production. This will allow you test all new releases, updates, and configuration changes prior to production release.

This can be achieved for a fraction of the cost it would have cost you on premise. With this capability, it could reduce the amount of bugs and negative experiences received by our customers and this element of the deployment would pay for itself in no time.

Services and applications when deployed on the cloud are designed differently to those on premise to help with scalability and flexibility. As a result, a review of how your applications and services are compiled mainly to be factored into your business deployment processes.

Typically you'll need to adopt a deep coupled architecture approach. Your operational support teams will also be impacted as the previous tools and monitoring that they may have used to manage on premise architecture may become redundant for some infrastructure. Instead they could be using the built in monitoring plus any third party cloud monitoring tools available.

As a result, your operational teams may have to interpret and manage additionally monitoring tools. Those who manage the existing on premise architecture and those who manage the new cloud services. Your operational teams will have to understand how to monitor managers in the new environment as it'll be very different from other trouble shooting methods they would already be used to.

Access to latest software. Typically, cloud providers offer you the latest operating systems along with related software. This is something that you may not have had access to before. As a result, you may need to adjust your own services, applications, or systems you'll be deploying to ensure it's compatibility.

This links closely with your new deployment options that you'll be utilizing because as a part of your deployment, you'll be able to select which version of software you'll be utilizing. Having the latest versions of operation systems and databases et cetera at your fingertips ensures that your services and applications are being offered the latest technology within that software such as new features and functions and additional security controls.

This could allow your development team to take advantage of this to create even greater applications and versions, utilizing any new features offered by the underlying system. This helps to make way for greater innovation, however this also means that your development team may need to work harder to keep up with service features.

Business awareness.

If you are an established organization, then trying to instill a new wave of technology that is so different from the current well known infrastructure can be hard to define as a great new initiative for all employees to back.

Some employees may not see it as a positive strategy which could be due to a lack of understanding which would also invoke fear about the job retention. Therefore not only is education as to what cloud computing is and the benefits it offers important but it requires a new mindset from all within the company so as to not impose worry or concern on your employees.

This transitional period can unbalance many organizations and affect moral and the whole business dynamic within the work force can come under strain. Communication is key for employees at this time.

If they feel they are being kept in the dark then you could lose some of the most valuable and essential employees. If you address how the cloud migration will affect them personally whilst offering reassurance that their jobs are safe, this will be of huge benefit to your business. Use a variety of methods when communicating these changes and share information to your employees often and as soon as you have it.

Provide avenues for your employees to asks questions, provide feedback, and offer their own ideas which will all help them engage and feel a part of the changes being suggested. It takes a change of mindset for most, if not all employees as in one way or another, everyone can be affected by a cloud migration. How you manage and educate your current staff could mean the difference between success and failure.

Resource recycling and allocation.

Following the migrational services to the cloud from one premise, you are likely going to have an abundance of redundant hardware with your data center. This opens up an opportunity to refresh some of the infrastructure that you will be keeping on premise. It will be a good idea to engage with your asset and life cycle teams along with operational support to determine the best course of action to do this. Where feasible and where it makes logical sense, upgrade the hardware on your on premise infrastructure from your newly redundant hosts.

Use this as an opportunity to bring your existing hardware up to speed along side your new infrastructure that will be hosted in the cloud. In addition to this and possibly a preferred instance in some cases, you could also add additional resiliency to your on premise services by duplicating the service and load balancing between them. Although this is a one time trade off from cloud migration, it's one that you should invest time and effort into as it could save your investing in additional hardware in the coming months for your outdated systems.

## Effects on Your Employees

Following a strategy whereby a new technology will be implemented whereby it may create new roles, make existing roles redundant and open up opportunities for employees to follow a new career direction, then you can expect that there will be a number of effects on your employees when it comes to adopting the cloud. Let's take a look at some of those.

Roles and opportunities.

Cloud adoption and migration can open up a new world of opportunities to your existing employees. New roles are likely to be created to help architect, implement, and support this new environment. However, not everyone may be as keen as you'd hoped.

You might have an instance whereby existing personnel are not interested in cloud computing, and do not want to pursue this as a part of their career. This is difficult to resolve from a business perspective, especially if the employee is one of your stronger members within the team with regards to their ability.

Depending on the scale of your cloud adoption, you may have to create an entirely new team specifically to manage the cloud environment from concept to operations. However, it's also likely you'll still have some resources on-premise which will need to be managed.

If there's a division within your team with regards to willingness to learn the new cloud principles, then you could split your operational support teams between on-premise and cloud. However, if you have a situation where you have too many employees in one area, then you may need to offer another role more suited to the employee.

If they still refuse to accept this change of role, then you may unfortunately need to resort to redundancy if their existing job role simply no longer exists within the business.

There's an unfortunate trade-off that sometimes comes with cloud computing, in that many of the services that were provided on-premise can easily be replicated in the cloud with a lot of the management and administration being taken care of by the provider.

As a result this can lead to existing roles within the organization becoming redundant. As a business, I would always encourage your existing personnel to take up any training offered in the foresight of utilizing this skillset elsewhere to avoid such actions.

One department that may be particularly affected by this is the data center team. Hosts will be moved from the data center and migrated to the cloud, and any future resource requests for certain services will be created within the cloud.

As a result, the footprint of the technical hole will reduce along with a rate at which the data center will grow. This will ultimately result in a reduction of personnel required to manage their environment.

As an example of a change of job role, you may have a data center architect familiar with Cisco network design, Check Point Security, Microsoft implementations and storage and backup solutions. However, you now require that same person to architect all of these solutions within the cloud.

Despite all of their current knowledge, this would not be possible without further training. They may understand specific principles, but many principles to do with networking and connectivity differ within the cloud.

If you were using AWS, then it would be advisable for them to become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect to understand how to implement such solutions.

Reassurance to your technical teams should be given at all times as to the safety of their roles if it exists. Communication is clear at this point and a development path should be made available to all if additional training is required. You will want to retain your key personnel and retrain others to ensure all have a key role to play.

Retraining existing personnel is sometimes easier than sourcing talent from outside of your organization as they will have already business awareness and you know their reliability and personality, and how they interact with the team around them.

Sometimes finding someone to fit in with a team is a difficult task. Even if they have the required skillset, they may not function with the rest of the department, which could cause a negative effect.

Now I'm not saying you shouldn't look outside of your organization as there will be times when you do need to source additional expertise perhaps due to time constraints of implementation or you require an expert within a specific area, such as a security specialist.

Training.

There's an obvious topic that springs to mind when looking at cloud adoption and migration from a personnel perspective, and that is education and training. Now there is more to training than that of the pure technical cloud content for your engineering and deployment teams.

Remember in the previous lecture where I briefly touched on business awareness? Well, here there was a requirement to educate and provide some form of training to everyone within the organization. Many people outside of the technical teams may not be aware of cloud computing is, why many people are using it, what it offers, the advantages and the benefits and why your business is looking to harness the power of the cloud.

I also mentioned that it's important for everyone to understand why this change of strategy is being adopted within your organization. Therefore, whilst investing training in your technical team's ability to handle the migration and ongoing support of that environment, you also need to offer some basic cloud principles and understanding and awareness to the rest of your organization.

There will be those who wish to gain an understanding of the technology that your company is wanting to implement. The training doesn't have to be a deep technical dive of cloud computing, but at the very least an overview of what it is and the characteristics should be offered. This will help your employees understand why you are implementing this change within the business.

Now on the other hand, there's the technical training required for your existing technical IT teams that will be performing the implementation, management, and operational support of the infrastructure. As this may be your first migration, you may not have many personnel that have the desired and required skills to carry out such a task of migrating services to the cloud.

With this in mind, your training needs to happen months in advance to allow your engineers adequate time to learn, understand, and become familiar with the technology before they implement a full scale migration. I would suggest providing both vendor agnostic training covering the principles of cloud computing along with vendor specific training where deep focus on the services you have architected can be given.

You will need to define the key strengths and weaknesses of your team members and how they could be used for different roles within cloud computing. Ascertain if anyone already has experience with cloud computing and specifically knowledge around the public vendor that you're aiming to use.

Perhaps AWS, Azure, or Google, to name the market leaders. It would be advantageous to your business to encourage certification within these areas as this validates your team knowledge and ability.

For AWS there are five certifications across two levels, these being Associate and Professional. The three Associates are the entry level certifications and are what people usually begin with before taking the more advanced and difficult Professional level. More information on these certifications can be found on the link onscreen.

For Microsoft Azure, there are currently two certifications, and again more information on these certifications can be found with the link onscreen. It's best to perform a skills gap analysis to ensure you know which areas to train which employee. Start by looking at what skills are required for your cloud migration. Then compare those to the skills of the skillset of your existing team and identify the gaps.

Now you have this information, you can formulate the relevant training path to ensure your team is ready with the ability and knowledge to carry out the task at hand. More recently within the training industry, different trends have been noticed. More and more organizations are choosing to adopt online training, such as this course you are watching now.

It allows the student to watch at their own pace and to go back on specific parts they are unsure of. This can't be achieved with a classroom instructor-led training day. However, each offers strengths and so it's down to your organization as to how you implement this training.

Mobility.

When adopting cloud services, it allows both employees and customers to access data from anywhere in the world as long you have an Internet connection and specific security controls allowing access.

With this in mind, your business can become flexible when it comes to your staff. The possibility of remote access and home working becomes more viable.

This also allows you to source talent from other areas of the country, or even different countries. If all systems are accessible via the cloud, then this is perfectly possible and feasible.

IT team contribution.

When systems and services are migrated to the cloud, it allows certain divisions within your IT department to spend more time focusing on business-orientated goals, such as IT strategy and innovation. As we know the cloud offers management, automation, self-healing architecture, and built-in monitoring features. It gives back time to engineers and developers, allowing them to direct their efforts into other areas.

This time can be spent advancing and updating existing releases, looking at IT industry strategies, and assessing how these could be implemented to the benefit of the business. In essence, less time will be spent on administering systems and instead the time can be better spent on enhancing existing and developing new services.

## Financial Impact

One of the reasons behind your move to the cloud would've most likely been financial. It's no secret as to how the costings against on-premise and the outer resources within the cloud compare, with cloud resources being significantly cheaper.

This allows for far cheaper flexibility, scalability, and capacity within your organization. This is largely do the large economy of scale that the public cloud providers can implement. However, let's take a look at some of the other less-obvious financial impacts of migrating services to the cloud.

Capex to Opex.

Cloud implementation offers advantages against on-premise, especially around your organization's Capex spend. To be clear, when additional resources are required, you will need to purchase the following as a Capex spend.

The host hardware, host upgrades such as additional storage, memory, and CPU, software, licenses, maintenance, new racking, and cabling. However, all of these are removed as a Capex expense within cloud computing.

As with cloud computing, you're not investing long-term into physical assets where the cost is spread over its useful life. Instead you are paying for short-term resources required to meet ongoing operational business requirements and are therefore classed as Opex costs.

When you have invested Capex into a resource, you are then fixed with that asset. Even if it fails, you still have to pay for it. Compare that to the Opex cost of cloud resources, you only pay for it when you're using it and you can upgrade at any point or stop using the resource altogether and your costs will cease.

Also you need to bear in mind that these Capex costs are not the only costs associated to new resources. There are also costs from the data center, such as space, power, calling, and maintenance, which all adds to the overall expense of the resource.

Again, these hidden costs are not applicable when utilizing cloud infrastructure, as all of those costs are the responsibility of the vendor, which can use economies of scale to keep these costs very low in the resources you need.

Cloud billing.

Your cloud environment can be architected in such a way that billing of services can be split and shared, for example between divisions, departments, and customers, giving greater cost association and tracking. Charges are based on consumption and so the business area is not to be paying over and above for what is utilized. Remember, we only pay for what we use.

Billing and utilization reports can be generated for each customer that are utilizing cloud services. Internally, this helps with departmental budgetary requirements.

Dependent on vendor, the finance team can be granted access to the cloud portal to allow them to directly create these reports and analyze the data, giving them full responsibility of managing all cloud finance accounts.

IT budget changes.

The budget allocation within the IT department will see a shift with regards to the budget spend on software, hardware, and support services. The budget spend for hardware will certainly decrease, as no hardware is required for cloud services, whilst at the same time reducing Capex cost in this area.

Supported services, such as staffing to manage, operate, and maintain that infrastructure will also decrease. However, the budget for software will rise, as this will incur the cost for all cloud services running.

To assist with the management of these costs, there are a number of cloud calculators available online, some offered by the cloud vendors themselves, such as a simple monthly calculator offered by Amazon web services, AWS.

HR costs.

As we explained in one of the previous lectures, there will be changes to roles and responsibilities. New positions may be created and old ones may become redundant. Generally, with a larger-scale cloud adoption and migration, the amount of personnel reduces, as many of the management and administrative function of the services are handed over to the cloud provider.

Severance and redundancy pay may have to be factored in, along with the recruitment costs of specialized cloud talent to fill any gaps within your workforce until the knowledge and expertise has been developed within the organization.

Improved efficiencies.

During the change of business dynamics lecture, I explained that a new approach and requirement would be needed for process and procedures. These new and improved processes must be more efficient than those previous, and must create an enhanced communication framework between other internal departments creating greater collaboration.

This will also increase employee productivity and morale through ease of procedures, essentially providing greater touring and better support to their working day. These efficiencies all lead to better management of time, resulting in better cost management of the overall workforce.

Rapid go-to market.

If you are operating within a business where you're bringing new products, applications, or services to market, then the cloud offers a great advantage in helping you complete this over a standard on-premise solution.

Using cloud resources to achieve this, and by bringing your product quicker to your customer, allows your organization to develop the next range of new products and releases even faster. This rapid turn-around of products and updates allows your business to grow at an increased rate from a revenue perspective.

## Contractual Business Obligations

Moving your services out of your own data center environment and into a third-party vendor's data center can cause issues and concerns when it comes to contractual obligations.

How will this move to the public cloud affect your service level agreements, your SLAs, with your customers? Will the cloud provider be able to operate at the same level? What reassurances can you offer your customers?

Having less visibility opens you up to a lot of unknowns when it comes to cloud production issues, especially when the resolution of those issues are out of your control. What kind of resiliency does the vendor have surrounding specific services across their environment?

It's important to look at your chosen vendor SLAs for each service that you are intending to use. Each service will have its own SLA with its own set of definitions of criteria to be met.

As an example, when looking at the SLA for the AWS EC2 service, you can see that it's made up of a number of different definitions, such as the Monthly Uptime Percentage, the Region Unavailability, and the Unavailability of EC2 and EBS.

Now, if we compare these definitions to another AWS service, AWS S3, you can see that it has different definitions and criterias, such as the Error Rate.

Be sure to analyze these SLAs to have a good understanding of what parameters the vendor has to abide by with regards to availability of service. Identify areas that fall outside of any SLAs you currently have in place with any of your customers. Depending on the type of service plan you have with your cloud provider, you may be able to negotiate specific terms surrounding SLAs that affect customer agreements.

However, these are likely to be small changes from the current SLAs that are stipulated. You will find that the cloud provider has the right to change the SLA terms as and when they see fit. The services they offer are ever changing, and so to keep up, so will the SLA agreement.

Be sure to review these SLAs regularly to ensure compliance with any contractual agreements you may have.

Sometimes, you may feel that you don't want to rely on statistics of the SLAs to ensure you maintain stability of a particular system or application. In this case, you can of course build in higher availability by architecting your systems to be fault tolerant across different geographic regions.

By doing so, it would protect you from a major incident on the cloud provider's part should a particular service offered fail in one region. If an incident occurred, your environment will handle this failure by utilizing the high availability system you architected to maintain reliability of service.

However, this does of course cost you the additional resource, and so it's a fine balance of defining if that particular workload requires that level of continuity.

Compliance controls.

In a standard on premise environment, you would have likely been audited by external auditors to check your IT infrastructure for compliance against security and data protection, or control surrounding PCI DSS, ISO, SOC, or even HIPAA.

There are many more compliance programs, but these are some of the most common.

To maintain compliance to these programs necessitates the need for the infrastructure which ultimately confirms that your customers' data is protected, and so is of course of the utmost importance.

Some responsibility of these compliance controls can now be passed over to the cloud provider, specifically elements geared toward physical security of the host, as we do not have access to the physical infrastructure. As a result, cloud providers have to abide by a huge set of compliance programs on a worldwide scale.

The large cloud providers, AWS, Azure, and Google, operate their services on a global level and therefore have to meet regulated controls of compliances from hundreds of different countries.

This is a great comfort to organizations operating within the cloud, as it's likely that the compliance of the services they are using are far greater than that compared to their own infrastructure.

For a full list of compliances offered by the leading cloud providers, please take a look at the links on the screen. You will still need to be responsible for specific compliance controls, and so do not think your provider will cover everything.

However, there are services that can help you with maintaining with this compliance. For example, the AWS Config service allows for the continual monitoring of the configuration of your assets. This service can use specific rule sets that check for audit compliance controls that relate to PCI DSS or HIPAA.

Reports can also be generated to verify conformity, allowing you to present to auditors.

## Business Risks

There will, of course, be a number of risks when implementing the cloud. In another course, Should Your Business Move to the Cloud?, we looked at some of the constraints which could also be seen as risks. And here, it looks at some of the technical risks that may arise.

In this section, I want to address it more from a business point of view.

Legislation and Regulation.

Your data may be bound by specific regulations, such as the EU data protection laws, which require specific security controls, retention requirements, et cetera, dependent on the data being stored. Other legislations exist where certain data may have to remain within a specific region and cannot be transferred out of those boundaries.

You need to architect your environment to meet these security requirements and mitigate the risk of data being stored in a geographic location that's restricted. Breaches to this legislation could have a legal impact and lead to additional risks against your organization. So it's fundamental that you're aware of your data privacy and storage location laws and regulations.

Technical Ability.

We briefly covered this in one of the previous lectures, so I won't go into any depth. But it's important to point out that the people you need to manage your current infrastructure may not be willing or keen to learn another technology specialization, especially if it doesn't really interest them on a technical or career level.

This becomes a technical ability risk to the business as you will not have the required work force with the adequate skills to confidently help you with the migration of your services to the cloud.

You need to ensure you have a completely new skill set from your employees to a level that has the knowledge to architect, implement, and administer the environment. Without this, your environment will end up failing from a productivity, security, and objective point of view.

Reliance on a Third Party.

Running services on the cloud removes control from your business. The loss of this control brings risks as you're now dependent on them performing their job effectively to manage the underlying architecture that your services are now running on.

Failure on their part could mean failure on yours and to your customers. This is where architecting a high availability solution between different geographic regions is key for critical workloads within the cloud to help mitigate cloud vendor failures. Failures within the cloud vendors does happen and has happened.

For example, this link on the screen shows you an AWS failure where an availability zone went down. Therefore, to help mitigate this risk for high-impacting services, some enterprise organizations are not choosing to adopt services from multi-cloud vendors, for example, from both AWS and Azure in a multi-vendor cloud configuration.

Inflexibility of Contracts.

When signing up to services by the public cloud vendor, you are bound to their customer agreement and terms of use, including any SLAs they offer for their services. As an example, you can find customer agreements for both AWS and Azure via these links on the screen.

To negotiate any specific term around your own special use cases, especially where it may affect SLAs would be very dependent on your support level with your chosen vendor and the amount of resources you intend to use. You may not be in a position to negotiate any changes, and therefore, you stuck with the SLAs and customer agreement terms that are offered.

If you don't like these conditions, then you can either change your business requirements or look at an alternate provider.

The Wrong Strategy Choice.

Okay, so you've moved to the cloud for specific business benefits and requirements. However, six months later, you are realizing that you're not reaching the benefits or goals that you set out to achieve. In fact, you are spending more on your infrastructure than you thought.

Whether it was a failure in your business plan, project management, or deployment of architecture and cost management, it has failed to meet your expectations.

So now what? Do you revert back to an on-premise solution which would cost additional capex, not to mention the cost of migration again? Or do you perhaps change your cloud deployment model? Perhaps you were using a public cloud model, but it may make better sense to use a hybrid cloud model. Maybe some of your applications and services could be better deployed through a Platform as a Service solution instead of an Infrastructure as a Service solution.

There will always be a risk of did we do it right? And the likelihood is the first time will not be right and you will adapt and change how your cloud services are deployed. You need to factor this learning period into your deployment and understand these changes.

Technology Advances.

The cloud provider is continually working to attain the highest level of technological advancements and this results in an ever-changing flow of their live services.

This doesn't always work in the favor of the business, as your applications and services that are deployed on top of these may have to have a slight modification to keep up with the different feature sets, which could affect your business services.

Shared Infrastructure.

Although the use of shared infrastructure is what helps to maintain a low price point for resources, it also acts as a potential security risk. For workloads that are of high sensitivity, it may require the use of dedicated hosts and tenancy, meaning that no other customer could store data on the same physical host.

The security applied on shared hosts is extremely high and operates at a number of different layers in the host and the hypervisor. However, should any breach to these areas, specifically the hypervisor, then in theory, customers could access each other's data.

Personally, I've not heard of this kind of breach happening within the leading cloud providers, but sometimes your business may not be able to take that risk for data that meets a certain criteria.

You will likely come across many more business risks within your own organization and it's important to define what these are and to understand how to mitigate those risks as much as possible.
