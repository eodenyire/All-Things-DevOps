As with any skill, we cannot go from "good" to "great" with just one leap onto the highest floor. We need to learn first what is the actual first step that we need to take to get some traction in the field of Cloud Computing.

Regardless of whether you're goal is to be a skilled network engineer, security specialist, software developer, or an all-around system administrator, you will benefit from learning the fundamentals of IT.

## So What is IT?

**Information Technology (IT)** is essentially the use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information. 

The IT industry refers to the entire scope of all the jobs and resources that are related to computing technologies within society, and there are a lot of different types of jobs in this field, from network engineers who ensure computers can communicate with each other, to hardware technicians who replace and repair components, to desktop support personnel who make sure that end users can use their software properly.

But IT isn't just about building computers and using the Internet, it's really about the people. That's the heart and soul of IT support work.

## IT as a Hot Skill 

There are many social and economic reasons why some people have digital literacy skills and other people do not. There's growing skills gap is known as the **digital divide**. 

The digital divide is a growing skills gap that separates those with digital literacy skills from those without. In today's world, IT skills have become essential for various activities such as job searching, education, and accessing health information. Those with digital skills have an opportunity to bridge this divide by helping others to confront and understand the socio-economic factors that contribute to the digital divide.
