# AWS Services 


In general, the AWS services can be categorized in the following:

- **Compute** - Service that can do work on data
- **Storage** - Service that hold data
- **Database** - Services that help catalog data
- **Data Movement** - Service that glue other services together ( by moving data or notify when data is ready to be processed)
- **Networking** - Services that create the network for users to access that data.
- **Security** - Service that provide security for your data

## Compute 

Compute resources can be considered the brains and processing power required by applications and systems to carry out computational tasks via a series of instructions. They are closely related to common server components such as CPUs and RAMs. A physical server within a data center would be considered a Compute resource, as it may have multiple CPUs and many gigs of RAM to process instructions given by the operating system and applications

Commonly used compute services:

- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Batch
- Amazon Lightsail
